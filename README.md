# EyeX ApiHost Application
Hardware-binding module of the EyeX Framework
## Features
### API Connection Module
- Establishes connection to different Eye-Tracking APIs
- Supported APIs: Tobii.Interaction, Tobii.Research (Pro)
### Data Processing
- Optional filters the raw GazePoint data with an average mean algorithm
- Implements an I-DT fixation detection algorithm based on Salvucci and Goldberg [1]
### API
Provides an interface for Client libraries to
- initialize the API
- (un)subscribe to GazePoint Data
- (un)subscribe to Fixation Data

## Usage
- Simple .exe Console/Forms Application (see release)
- Tobii EyeTracker has to be connected and calibrated first
- Runs on port 5000 - make sure it is not used by any other process

## Client Libraries
- IntelliJ: https://github.com/JanRankenhohn/eyex-lib
